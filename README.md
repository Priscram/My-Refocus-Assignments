# coding_challenge from My Refocus Assignments

== SHORT INTRODUCTION ==
Hi I am Priscram and I'd love to pursue my passion about Javascript coding.
I live in the small town of Poblacion Montevista, in the Province of Davao de Oro, in the Island of Mindanao, in my country Philippines.

== MY HOBBIES AND TRAVEL==
My hobbies are sinnging while I got coding challenge resolved, and in my spare time I usually went into our small farm enjoying the freshness of nature at Montevista, Davao de Oro, Philippines. I used to fly to Metro Manila to take my vacation at the end of the year to unwind with my relatives and siblings since 2019.

== GOALS FOR THIS YEAR 2023 ==
One of my key milestones in life this year 2023 is to become a master full stack web developer. My goal in this learning journey is to master Javascript and the latest emerging technologies, henceforth, I can land a high paying job in the SASS industry.
I will define Javascript Master as a full stack web developer who can create websites from scratch and enabling data security as well as ensuring a user friendly user interface of the software applications.

== REASONS WHY AND WHAT INSPIRES ME TO BECOME A WEB DEVELOPER ==
Financial scarcity is the precursor why I decided to learn more about coding. Back in the year 2016 when I started making websites using platforms such as WordPress, Zyro, Google Sites, I find it intimadating because of their lack of features that the other competitors have such as Divi, InstaPage, Clickfunnels, etc., but it turned out to be charging hefty prices monthly by which I can't afford back in the days because of my continued support to my two brothers until now who are in the state of mental disorders which had just started back in the year 2011, the year my mother was also hospitalized due to her breast mass. All those incidents and not to mention all other scams I had went through summed up to accumulating debts and financial disaster. 
Added with additional hardships when Covid-19 pandemic took widespread back in December 2019 and had brought economic crisis to the bank company where I was working with from which my financial sustenance came forth, by then later on; that company underwent into downsizing mechanism just to survive afloat.
And because Javascript is one of the top technology in the SASS industry that has a tremendous volume of users as well as its demand in its usability in creating programs, I choose to prioritize this above PHP and Phyton.
Based on the data I have searched online, I cling to a better tomorrow with Javascript developers demand.

== MY LEARNING JOURNEY ==
Learning to code with real case projects using visual studio code is awesome for me. What a great learning challenge from Refocus team! 
I am asking generous developers to contribute to my learning journey by giving me tips in coding particularly in Javascript.
