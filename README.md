# coding_challenge
Learning to code with real case projects using visual studio code. Great learning challenge from refocus team. 
I am encouragung generous developers to contribute to my learning journey by giving me tips in coding particularly in Javascript.
My way of giving you credits to your contribution is by mentioning your names when I share this repo to my friends.
Your use of the software is for educational purposes it may deem.
I welcome your suggestions if we can collaborate for future ideas and projects.
